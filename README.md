# Team Portfolio Website

This repository contains a **one-page animated team portfolio website** built using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and GSAP**.

This is our **first serious step into freelancing** as a small college team.  
No fake claims. No imaginary clients. Just honest work and real effort.

---

## Why this website exists

We are a small team of three friends from college who decided to **stop waiting for “perfect experience”** and start building something real.

We wanted:
- A professional online presence as a **team**, not individuals
- A portfolio that looks premium but stays simple
- Privacy (no personal photos, no phone numbers)
- A site that reflects **what we can do**, not what we wish we could do

This website is the result.

## What this website includes

- Custom **loading screen**
- Name input → personalized welcome screen
- Smooth transition into the main hero section
- One-page layout (no multiple pages)
- Animated sections using **GSAP**
- Services section (React, frontend, backend, UI/UX)
- Projects section based on **college + GitHub projects**
- Clear process section (how we work)
- Team section with roles (no real photos)
- Contact section with:
  - Gmail template email link
  - LinkedIn profile link
- Clean footer

Everything is intentionally minimal and professional.

## Tech Stack

- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- JavaScript (Vanilla JS)  
- GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)

No frameworks. No shortcuts.

## Real struggles while building this

This project was **not easy**, and pretending otherwise would be a lie.

Some real problems faced:

- Understanding **how animations should feel**, not just work
- Making GSAP animations smooth without breaking scroll behavior
- Figuring out how to handle:
  - loading screen
  - name input
  - timed welcome screen
  - automatic transition to hero section
- Learning that `mailto:` links **don’t work everywhere**
- Finding a reliable email solution (Gmail template links)
- Realizing LinkedIn **does not allow pre-filled messages**
- Designing sections without any real client projects
- Writing content without sounding fake or overconfident
- Balancing creativity with professionalism
- Fixing things that “should work” but didn’t

A lot of time went into:
- debugging
- rewriting sections
- removing overcomplicated ideas
- keeping the site clean instead of flashy

This website exists because of **iteration**, not perfection.

## About the team

We are a **college team** with skills across:
- Frontend development
- Backend development
- Database handling
- UI/UX
- React-based web apps

This is our **starting point**, not our final form.

---

## Important note

- This is **not a client portfolio**
- These are **team & college projects**
- We do **not claim production-level experience**
- We value **honesty over hype**

---

## What’s next

- Improve animations
- Add real client projects when we get them
- Refine UI/UX based on feedback
- Optimize performance
- Possibly convert this into a React version later

---

## Final words

This project represents:
- learning
- mistakes
- patience
- teamwork
- and the decision to start instead of waiting

If you’re reading this and you’re also starting from zero —  
this is proof that **starting messy is better than not starting at all**.
